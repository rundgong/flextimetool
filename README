FlexTimeTool by Markus Eriksson

Track your working time by sensing your presence at the computer.
It logs all activity to easily readable text files and calculates your +/-
flex time balance.

FlexTimeTool comes in two versions. The main version (XFlexTimeTool) uses the
X11 screensaver libs to monitor activity and the "old" version (FlexTimeTool)
uses /dev/input events to sense mouse or keyboard usage.
By default events are read from /dev/input/event0 but that can be changed in 
the configuration file.

Reading events from /dev/input/event0 may need root privileges, depending on
how your system is setup.


How does it work?
  It remembers the first and last time you are active in the day and then 
  subtracts a predefined amount of lunch time. Your work day is by default 8
  hours and your lunch break 40 minutes, but this can be customized.
  A lunch break is only subtracted if you work more than 5 hours.
  
  When it is started it will read back the previously stored data and continue
  counting from that. Since all logs are stored in easy to edit human readable
  form it is easy to change the logs and add working time if you work out of
  office for a day so it did not register, or you want to add an hour that you
  worked from home in the morning before you came in to the office.
  
  Note that you can not edit the logs while it is running since the program 
  will overwrite your changes. You need to kill the program first to make sure
  your edits will not conflict with what the program is writing.
  
  If there is no registered activity at all on a normal working day it does NOT
  subtract any flex time. If you want to subtract a whole day see below in the
  section called "Log files"

  
Building:
- Dependencies:
  XFlexTimeTool depends on these libraries.
  * X11 (libx11-dev on Ubuntu), 
  * libxscrnsaver (libxss-dev)

- To build, just run "make" to build all targets 
  or the individual targets "make x", "make devinput", "make simulation" 
  depending on what you want to build.


Installation:
  FlexTimeTool requires no installation but you may want to copy it to your 
  bin path.
  FlexTimeTool needs a working directory to store its data files. By default
  it uses $HOME/.flextimetool but you can override this with a switch at run
  time. If the working directory does not exist it will be created.

  
Configuring:
  FlexTimeTool reads config parameters from a file named flextimetool.conf 
  in the working directory if it exists. See flextimetool.conf.template for
  more info.


Running:
  Just fire it up in your favorite console, and leave it there. It will update
  the current flex balance on the screen in real time.


Log files:
  Log files are put in the working directory, one for each month.
  The file names are YYYY-MM.flexlog, where YYYY=Year and MM=Month.
  
  Each day is log on a separate line with the following format
  Date: start.time-end.time; target.working.time; lunch.time; daily.flex#comment
  After the hash(#) you can add a comment or note to the end of the line.
  Below is an example log file:
---------------------------------------
previous flex: 5.32
25: 08.00-17.00; 8.00; 0.40; +0.20#
26: 08.12-15.20; 8.00; 0.40; -1.32# Left early to go to the dentist
27: 08.15-17.19; 8.00; 0.40; +0.24#
total flex: 4.44
---------------------------------------
  
  Q: How do I subtract a whole day?
  A: You manually add a day with 0 worked minutes as follows
     28: 08.15-08.15; 8.00; 0.40; -8.00#
